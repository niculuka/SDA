/**
 * Create a ThreadPlaygroundRunnable class that implements the Runnable interface having a name field of
 * type String with a public constructor for that field.
 * The class should implement the run() method from the Runnable interface.
 * This method should contain a loop iterating up to 10 and print the name of the current
 * thread using Thread.currentThread().getName(), the name given in the constructor and the current iteration number.
 * Create a class that has two private static Thread fields and a standard public static void main (String []
 * args) method.
 * Then initialize the Thread fields using the constructor that accepts the Runnable object and
 * pass ThreadPlaygroundRunnable creating it using the constructor, each time giving a different name.
 * On each thread (Thread) use the start() method.
